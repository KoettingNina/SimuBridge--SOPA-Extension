# SimuBridge-OLCA <br><sub>![CI](https://github.com/INSM-TUM/SimuBridge--Main/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)</sub>

## :information_source: About
This repository is a supplementary branch to the main [SimuBridge](https://github.com/INSM-TUM/SimuBridge) project. It contains the source code for the web application that is the heart piece of the project. Please refer to the [SimuBridge project root repository](https://github.com/INSM-TUM/SimuBridge) for overall project documentation.

This project focuses on **sustainability related information on SimuBridge**. The extensions made allows users to assign probabilistic distributions to cost driver concretizations. The platform facilitates a deeper understanding of the environmental implications of different operational choices, providing valuable insights for sustainable decision-making. 
To this end, it communicates with the sustainability database software [openLCA](https://www.openlca.org/) and the business process simulation engine [Scylla](https://github.com/bptlab/scylla) using a tailored [plugin](https://github.com/INSM-TUM/Scylla-Plugin--SOPA).

Have a look at the [demo](./demo) folder for a little demonstration how the extension works.

## Quick Start
The fastest way to setup the system is to use the provided `docker-compose` file provided with this repository - no git checkout needed. As a prerequisite, Docker needs to be installed
To do so, first download  the <a href="./docker-compose.yml" download> docker-compose.yml</a>.
Then run the following command in the folder where you downloaded the compose file:
``` posh
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```
This will set-up SimuBridge as well as Scylla (including the necessary plugins) and the Simod simulation model discovery tool.


#### OpenLCA & Example Data Setup
To install openLCA, go to https://www.openlca.org/download/ and download and run the respective installer.
Download the demo data we provide at `./demo/LCA/demo_dataset.zolca` and import into openLCA via `File > Import > File > demo_dataset.zolca`. Open the demo database by double-clicking on it. Start the IPC server of openLCA by clicking `Tools > Developer tools > IPC Server`, entering port `8081` and clicking `run`. Open SimuBridge in the browser at `http://localhost:3000` and select the `OpenLCA Integration` menu entry. Click `Fetch Impact Methods`, select an impact method such as `ReCiPe 2016 Endpoint (H)` and click `Calculate`. Proceed to configure the simulation scenario and environmental cost variants. The `demo` folder of this repository provides three sample process models and event logs you can use to test out the main functionalities of the SOPA-SimuBridge integration.


## üì¶Ô∏è Added & Extended UI Pages
This extension adds and extends multiple pages to the basic SimuBridge UI.

This step only fetches the impact method and normalization set. The cost computation is taken out in this step. 


### LCA Variant Configuration (added)

- **Parameter Configuration**: Configure distribution parameters for each concrete driver:
- **Information Tooltips**: Access detailed descriptions of concrete cost drivers via info icons


## üìä Supported Distribution Types
The system supports various statistical distributions for parameterizing concrete cost drivers:

- **Constant**: Fixed value distribution with configurable target unit (e.g., kg*km, t*km)
- **Normal**: Gaussian distribution with mean and variance parameters
- **Exponential**: Exponential distribution with mean parameter
- **Uniform**: Uniform distribution with lower and upper bounds
- **Triangular**: Triangular distribution with lower, peak, and upper bounds
- **Erlang**: Erlang distribution with order and mean parameters
- **Binomial**: Binomial distribution with probability and amount parameters
- **Arbitrary Finite Probability Distribution**: Custom probability distributions

Each distribution type includes appropriate parameter validation and supports different target units for environmental impact calculations.
